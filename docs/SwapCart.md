### **Objective**
To create a platform where users can list their items and find others to swap with, instead of buying or selling. 
The system uses smart suggestions to match swap interests and shows nearby listings to make physical exchanges easier.

### **Goals**
- Enable users to list items they want to give and what they want in return.
- Suggest potential swaps automatically based on listing data.
- Allow users to search and filter items based on category, location, or preferences.
- Enable real-time chat or contact option between users.
- Show nearby listings to encourage local swaps.
